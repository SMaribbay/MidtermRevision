    <p> Wong Kar Wai's third film features two separate but loosely tied stories in one with both set against the backdrop of the vibrant, bustling city of Hong Kong.
      The first half of the film features Takeshi Kaneshiro as Cop 223 who has just recently broken up with his girlfriend. Bogged down by heartbreak and loneliness, he wanders around Hong Kong consuming cans of pineapples in rememberance of his once-happy times.
      That is until he runs into a woman in a blonde wig (Brigitte Lin) who is also expressing similar feelings as him. They form an odd but perfect connection sharing their loneliness together.
    In the second half of the film, we see the return of Tony Leung as Cop 663 who is also dealing with a breakup. He runs into the new girl Faye (Faye Wong) working at a lunch counter who changes his life without him even noticing.</p>
